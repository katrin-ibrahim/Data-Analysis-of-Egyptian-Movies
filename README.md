# Data Analysis of Egyptian Movies


# Brief about project:
- The project targets the textual analysis of Egyptian movie plot
  summaries that were curated from online sources, covering the four golden decades
  of Egyptian Cinema.
- The project involves the implementation of a textual data analysis pipeline, from
  data cleaning to data analysis to producing and communicating insight.
- The analysis involves the incorporation of different attributes about the targeted
  movies, including movie features and synopsis, and applying data cleaning
  techniques to handle missing/incorrect data and handle Arabic language
  inconsistencies. Textual synopses will be processed and analyzed in order to
  discover movie clusters and similarities between movie plots.
- Insights will be communicated via visualizations and a potential web platform.
